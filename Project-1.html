    <h3>Blurb</3><br>
I shouldn't want him, but my body yearns for the shadows wrapping around me.

All my family are hunters. We're special---or the knives we have are. After finishing my last assignment, I've been reassigned to kill the riskiest assignment for a human: a shadow monster. Only my knife can kill them. As I start tracking my monster, he finds me first and shows me everything those shadowy tentacles can do..

Instead of killing him, he's teasing me and helping me kill other monsters. As my guilt and my desires start to take control of my life, the truth is revealed when a fellow hunter tries to kill me. This has all been a setup to eliminate me. Now, I'll have to trust the monster I was supposed to kill to save my life and my family's.

Will we find the murderous hunter before she kills me? After all of Amzar's lies, will I trust him with my heart and leave my hunter life?</article>
